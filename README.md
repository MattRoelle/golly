# GOLLY

### Game Oriented Lua Lisp.

This code is extremely experimental and undocumented, the API is changing daily. Working on an indie game project in parallel and building the parts of this engine when the game project necessitates them. If you're brave and want to play with the code please reach out to me for help. 

## Examples

For right now, the repo is just a love project. The main entry point to the example is [example-asteroids/init.fnl](example-asteroids/init.fnl). Run using `love ./`.
